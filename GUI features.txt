What types of GUI control (widget) should I have?

1) An application
2) A window. Either a single document interface or a multiple document interface (SDi / MDI).
- An application menu. This may be relevant for Apple systems, but usually in Windows systems this would be integrated into the main menu
- A main menu - This will remain relatively fixed.
- A context menu - This will change depending upon what is actually selected. It is usually triggered by a right mouse click in Windows but on Apple systems it might be <Control> left click.

Some menu options may have different states, i.e. an option might be greyed out if it not currently available.
Some menu options may have a ticked state. For example to indicate if a toolbar is visible ot not there may be a tick beside it.
Some menu options may be completely runtime dependent, for example the list of fonts may depend upon the actual installation being run.

Floating tool palettes. These can be dragged to the edges of the screen to dock or can be torn off and dragged around the screen independently.

Buttons - These Are Usually images with a push state, but they could also be toggle switches or they could be radio buttons.
